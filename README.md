# Dreamsong Theater Macro
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/DaRealFreak/bns-dst)  
Macro to farm the dungeon "Dreamsong Theater" automatically. While essentially still being a macro with just some color checks this can possibly get you banned though. Usage is therefore obviously on your own risk.

## Installation
You'll have to configure quite a few parts of this repository to get this macro to work with your ClientConfiguration.xml and settings.
But for the installation itself you only need [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installation.  
Execute the `main.ahk` for the main functionality. If your Blade & Soul is running as administrator you'll have to execute the `main.ahk` also as administrator. Else the script doesn't require administrator rights.

## Configuration

### [config.ahk](config.ahk):
Here you can configure multiple options for the macro. This includes hotkeys for the repair tools/buff food/speedhack and the configured speed.  
I can't help with what settings you want or hotkeys you want to use, just read the functions and decide yourself.

### [ui.ahk](ui.ahk):
The most important file to configure. This class contains pixel positions and color codes which are depending on your resolution and ClientConfiguration.xml.
Basically read the function name and the doc block to see what position you have to check with `F1`. `F1` will insert the relevant code at your current mouse position into your clipboard and you can just paste it.  
Only exceptions are the functions `ClickEscape`, `ClickEscapeCrossServer` and `IsTalismanAvailable`.
Both ClickEscape functions only require the x and y coordinates of your escape options. You can copy those also from the code generated by the `F1` functionality.  
`IsTalismanAvailable` should use one of the last dark pixels before the talisman goes off cooldown which is NOT transparent.
If you don't play with the `WaitForLongSoul` option you can ignore it though.

### [class.ahk](class.ahk)
Here you can simply include the class you want to play. If the class is not implemented yet feel free to create the configuration for your class and create a pull request.
This includes things like double cc, iframe/block timings and general auto combat configurations. No UI configurated stuff is recommended here, since the use should be for every user.

### [hotkeys.ahk](hotkey.ahk)
If you want to change the macro hotkeys for the functionality you're free to do here.

## Usage
The default hotkeys for the macro are:
| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| F1 | Color Check at current mouse position |
| Numpad 0 | Start the farm macro |
| Numpad Delete | Reload the farm macro |
| Numpad Enter | Fully close the farm macro |

As mentioned above you can change those hotkeys in the [hotkeys.ahk](hotkeys.ahk)
